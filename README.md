# Pleiades.

A Flutter project of a movies/TV shows* app to stay up to date with new releases.

This app shows the lastest and upcoming movies/TV shows* using [The Movie Data Base](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API.

The name comes from the [cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades) with the same name, since this app pretends to be a cluster of information to everyone.

*: The app is still in a very early developing process and some features may not be implemented yet.
